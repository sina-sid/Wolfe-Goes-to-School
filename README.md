# Wolfe-Goes-to-School
For Fall 2016 05-499C: Twitch Plays Game Design final project

For our project, we chose to implement a Twitch Plays style game where Twitch audiences can help pick a wolf which has disguised itself as one of 
the classmates at the school. In order to do this, we have votes coming in using an open source solution to grab the twitch chat votes https://github.com/Grahnz/TwitchIRC-Unity using IRC. After, we are storing votes that are given to us in data structures in out Game Logic Tree Singleton which contains 
all necessary dialog needed for this project. This GLT singleton contains a lot of our back end code for this project. After that, we have various scenes and 
transitions that build on this dialog such as scenes to show users voting for questions and person to "kill" and so on which use a lot of resources that were generated by our awesome designers. Currently some parts of our project do not work, there are some cutscenes that don't currently work right now.
